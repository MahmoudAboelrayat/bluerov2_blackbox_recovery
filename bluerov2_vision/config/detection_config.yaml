# YOLOv11 Detection Configuration

# Model confidence threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
# Lower values detect more objects but with more false positives
confidence: 0.5

# IOU threshold for NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
# Controls how much overlap is allowed between detections
threshold: 0.45

# Camera resolution (width, height)
camera_resolution:
  width: 640
  height: 480

# Model settings
model:
  # Path to model weights (relative to script directory)
  weights_path: "weights/best.pt"
  
  # Device: "cpu" or "0" (for GPU)
  device: 0
